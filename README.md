# FreeRTOS-PicoLab

## Overview
FreeRTOS-PicoLab is an innovative project designed to integrate FreeRTOS with the Raspberry Pi Pico, utilizing the Arduino IDE for development. This project serves as an exploration into the capabilities and applications of a real-time operating system (RTOS) within the Raspberry Pi Pico environment. The project begins with a fundamental example of blinking an LED, demonstrating basic RTOS principles.

## Getting Started
The project builds upon the Arduino-Pico core developed by earlephilhower. To set up your development environment and gain more insight, please refer to the [earlephilhower's Arduino-Pico GitHub repository](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico) and the comprehensive [official Arduino-Pico documentation](https://arduino-pico.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

### Initial Setup
1. Ensure that your Arduino IDE is configured for the Raspberry Pi Pico by following the guidelines provided in the Arduino-Pico documentation.
2. Clone the FreeRTOS-PicoLab repository to your local machine to begin development.
3. Launch the Arduino IDE and open the project files from the cloned repository.

### First Example: Blinking LED
Our first practical example showcases the use of FreeRTOS to control the onboard LED of the Raspberry Pi Pico. This example serves as an introductory exercise, familiarizing users with basic RTOS tasks and synchronization mechanisms on the Pico platform.

Stay tuned for more advanced examples and tutorials as we dive deeper into the world of real-time systems with the Raspberry Pi Pico and FreeRTOS.
