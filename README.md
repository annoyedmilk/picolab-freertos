# FreeRTOS-PicoLab

## Overview
PicoRTOS is a project focused on exploring the integration of FreeRTOS with the Raspberry Pi Pico using the Arduino IDE. It serves as an experimental platform to understand real-time operating systems on the Pico hardware, starting with a simple LED blink example.

## Getting Started
This project uses the Arduino-Pico core by earlephilhower, which allows for Arduino-style coding for the Raspberry Pi Pico. Detailed instructions for setting up the Arduino IDE with Raspberry Pi Pico support can be found in the [Arduino-Pico documentation](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico).

### Initial Setup
1. Install the Arduino IDE and configure it for Raspberry Pi Pico as per the instructions in the Arduino-Pico repository.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open the project in the Arduino IDE.

### First Example: Blinking LED
The first example involves setting up the Raspberry Pi Pico and making its onboard LED blink using FreeRTOS tasks.
